        "title": "Babies learn language from rhythmic information, not phonetic sounds",
        "content": "University of Cambridge researchers discovered that infants learn languages through rhythmic speech, like nursery rhymes, rather than phonetic information. Their study, involving 50 infants&#39; brain activity recordings, found that reliable phonetic processing starts around seven months. This challenges prior beliefs about language learning and suggests a potential link between rhythm perception and dyslexia or developmental language disorders. The findings emphasize the importance of singsong speech in early language development.",
